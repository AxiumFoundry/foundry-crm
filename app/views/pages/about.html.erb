        <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            I started Axium Foundry after seeing the same problem over and over: ambitious founders with great ideas, stuck waiting months to hire senior engineers or burning cash on offshore teams that deliver technical debt.
          </p>

          <p>
            The typical options all suck. Heroku-style platforms lock you in and cost 3x more. AWS overwhelms with complexity. Offshore dev shops produce code you'll spend twice as much fixing later. Junior developers mean months of management overhead. And hiring senior engineers? That's 3-6 months of recruiting before a single line of code.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">
            There had to be a better way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Axium Foundry is that better way. You get senior engineering expertise when you need it, without the overhead of full time hires. I build fast, I build right, and I don't lock you into anything proprietary. You own your code, you control your infrastructure, and you can hire your own team whenever you're ready.

              Rails isn't trendy, it's proven. It powers Shopify, GitHub, Basecamp, and thousands of successful startups. Combined with modern deployment tools, it's the fastest way to build and the cheapest way to run.

        <h2 class="text-section mb-8">Why Rails, Hotwire, and Turbo Native?</h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <p>
            <strong class="text-white">Rails</strong> is still the fastest way to build web applications. It's been around since 2004, powers some of the biggest companies in tech, and has a massive ecosystem of gems and developers. Most importantly, it lets you ship fast without accumulating technical debt.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong class="text-white">Hotwire and Turbo</strong> let you build modern, reactive interfaces without heavy JavaScript frameworks. You get the speed and interactivity users expect, with less complexity and better maintainability. No more managing state across two separate applications (backend and frontend).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong class="text-white">Turbo Native</strong> is the secret weapon for mobile. Wrap your Rails app in a native iOS shell and you have a real App Store app—with 100% code sharing. Companies like Basecamp and HEY have proven this approach works at scale. For startups, it means shipping mobile without hiring mobile developers.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">
            This isn't the newest stack. It's the stack that works.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card-clean bg-dark-lighter">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">What if you need something else?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I'm pragmatic. If your specific requirements genuinely need a different stack, I'll tell you honestly and potentially recommend other partners. But 95% of startups don't need the complexity of microservices, separate frontend frameworks, or native mobile codebases. Rails + Hotwire + Turbo Native covers most use cases faster and cheaper.
